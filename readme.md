# Project SilverMosquitoStorm
A discord bot created by me, Connor Groen.<br>
Made using [Discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py), this bot is not a very good nor talented bot.

## Commands
Currently, there aren't many commands that the bot is capable of doing.

**Help**
<br>
`-help`: displays a embed that provides the syntax and description of each command.

**Ping**
<br>
`-ping`: responds with "pong" while also displaying the latency.


**Clear**
<br>`-clear`: removes the previous five messages in the channel, as well as the message used to initiate the command.

`-clear [number]`: removes the specified amount of messages, as well as the message used to initiate the command.
